Math and statistics is unreasonably powerful, but this stuff is hard.  It’s really easy to confuse or delude yourself and others into believing data says something, when it doesn't (“Lies, Damned Lies, and Statistics!”).  The best advice is to proceed with caution and train yourself to spot biases and become aware of them.

The following are description of some binary classification jargon that are common to many fields (data mining, machine learning, information retrieval, statistics, medicine...) and their common synonyms.  While binary classification may seem too limited to be of much use, in fact any multiclass classifier can be judged on the basis of "correct/incorrect" and this is sufficiently useful.  To the point, it also describes how science can come to sound or erroneous conclusions.

True/False Positive/Negative translate fairly well for simple binary classification where the answer is "correct" or "incorrect", like when using the scientific method to reject a null hypothesis, but when generalizing to many classifications, different fields are generally concerned with different things.  The Information Retrieval field is concerned with retrieving documents from a database, only some of which are relevant.  As we start thinking about theoretical distributions and real, dynamic populations, we're interested in generalizing propertiees from those distributions and measuring the performance of our models.


* True Positive: Increases a test's **sensitivity**

* True Negative: Increases a test's **sensitivity**, also called the power

* False Positive: Type 1 error

* False Negative: Type II error

# Accuracy
# Precision, Recall
# Prevalence, Incidence
# Lift
# Gold Standard

...

* Accuracy - Correct / Attempted
* Precision / positive predictive value
* Recall / Sensitivity / true positive rate
* Lift
